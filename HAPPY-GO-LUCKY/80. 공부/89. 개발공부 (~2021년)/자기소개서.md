총 직원수는 대략 60명정도 입니다.  주로 컨설턴트들로 이루어져 있으며 개발인력은 점차 늘리고 있는 중입니다.

저희 회사의 주업무에 대해 자세히 설명드리면,  저희 회사의 주업무는CRM, SEM, DW컨설팅 및 솔루션을 제공하는 것입니다.

CRM은 Customer Relationship Management의 약자이며 기업이 고객과 관련된 내외부 자료를 분석·통합해 고객 중심자원을 극대화하고 이를 토대로 고객특성에 맞게 마케팅 활동을 계획·지원·평가하는 과정입니다.

SEM은 Strategic Enterprise Management 의 약자이며 기업의 가치를 극대화하기 위한 방향으로 경영 전략을 수립하고 그 전략대로 경영 활동이 효과적으로 이루어질 수 있도록 전략 중심형 조직을 구축하고 실행하는 경영 프로세스와 시스템으로 운영되는 기업경영체를 말합니다.

DW는 대량의 데이터를 기반으로 사용자가 쉽게 접근할 수 있고 다양한 분석을 펼칠 수 있는 분석용 데이터베이스입니다.

크게 이 세가지에 대한 컨설팅팀이 있고, 제가 속한Technical Research Center 는 CRM, SEM, DW, Bigdata에 관한 연구개발업무를 하고 있습니다.

저의 전공은 자동차공학이고 기계설계부분에서 1년동안 근무하였고,

그 후에 IT엔지니어 이신 아버지밑에서 IT를 시작하게 되었습니다.

현재까지 IT 경력은 이번달을 포함하여 4년입니다. 저희 회사에서 일하면서CRM, SEM, DW, Bigdata에 관한 개발에 참여하고 있습니다.

그리하여 저는 IT에 관한 시야를 넓힐 수 있었습니다.

하지만 저는 제가 작은 세상에 있었다는 것을 중국 출장을 통해 깨닫게 되었습니다.

저는 중국의 대단하지 않지만 아이디어를 보게 되었습니다. 그들은 한국에서 보다 자연스럽게 IT를 이용하고 있다는 것에 저는 감명받았습니다.

그래서 저는 이번에 실리콘밸리에 있는 동안 제 IT 배경지식을 넓히고 제가 관심있는 분야인 빅데이터에 대해 더 공부하고 싶습니다.
